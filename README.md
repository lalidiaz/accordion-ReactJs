# accordion-ReactJs

This is the 4th project to refresh ReactJs concepts. I am writing an article about ReactJs main concepts so I can share it with the community once it's finished.
In this app you can read about Waitomo Caves (New Zeland), you can click the button to see more info.

Topics:

• useEffect() => fetch data. • Conditional Rendering
